Notes on the following list of variables:
	-For some of the following variables, the suffixes X, Y and Z denote the 3 dimensions of measurement
	-The suffix "mean" indicates the variable contains the means of the measurements
	-Similarly the suffix "std" denotes the variable contains the standard deviation of the measurements
	-The variables in the list below have the prefix "Time", which denotes these measurements are from the time domain. 
	-Equivalent definitions apply for the same variables which have the prefix "Freq", which denote the measurements were taken in the frequency domain.
